## Circle Books

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
The UI is formed from Shadcn and Tailwindcss.

The page has been deployed in an Azure Static Web App and can be viewed [here](https://white-mushroom-047d02110.5.azurestaticapps.net/).

The backend is a mock API by [Mocki.io](https://mocki.io/fake-json-api).

The concept of this project arose from a front-end developer role take-home project that I saw whilst scrolling through the market.

Designs were prototyped in Figma and can be [viewed here](https://www.figma.com/proto/9QRt6dONYAiEnCHtmI6cUu/Circle---Frontend-Challenge?node-id=19-1462&t=pZbOHM7XAcUSxmZH-1).
